  The type of item that a thread is associated with.

  Used in conjunction with contextId to find the item with which a thread
  is associated, and then to determine whether the authenticated user has
  permission to perform the requested action.

  Currently, only comms is supported, but it is intended that other
  contexts will be introduced.
