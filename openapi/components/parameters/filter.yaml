name:        filter
in:          query
description: |
  A set of filters (if any) which will be used to filter out the list of
  items that this endpoint returns.

  Generally, the structure of this object will match the structure of
  the object that the endpoint returns: any object which is like the
  filter object passed in will be returned in the search.

  Values in the object may either be scalars (the field must equal this
  value), or objects with a particular key:
  * equals: the field must equal the value of this key
  * in: the field must be one of the values of this key
  * between: the field must be between the two values of this key
  * lessThan, greaterThan: the field must be one of the values of this key

  Fields of sub-objects may also be used in filters.

schema:
  type: object
example:
  # fetch an item whose ID = 5
  - id: 5
  # fetch an item whose ID = 5
  - id:
      equals: 5
  # fetch an item whose ID is 1, 3 or 5
  - id:
      in: [1, 3, 5]
  # fetch an item whose ID is less than 17
  - id:
      lessThan: 17
  # fetch an item whose ID is between 1 and 5
  - id:
      between: [1, 5]
  # fetch an item whose role ID is 1
  - role:
      id: 1
  # fetch an item whose role type is staff
  - role:
      type: staff
  # fetch an item whose role type is staff or parent
  - role:
      type:
        in: [staff, parent]
  # fetch an item whose role type is staff or parent,
  # and whose ID < 17
  - role:
      type:
        in: [staff, parent]
    id:
      lessThan: 17
