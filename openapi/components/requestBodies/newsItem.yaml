        audience:
          type: array
          description: |
            An array of strings, each in one of two formats:
            * for simple audiences: `$entityType:$entityValue:$relationship`
            * for composite audiences: `composite;$relationship;`, then two
              simple audiences, delimited by a `.` character

            The variables within the audience string have this meaning:
            * `$entityType` is the type of audience: currently out of
              `campus`, `folder`, `role`, `school_house`, `year`
            * `$entityValue` is the identifier for the audience, JSON-encoded
              then base64-encoded
            * `$relationship` is the users who are actually in the identified
              audience:
              * `self` for the users associated directly with the audience
              * `teachers_of` for the teachers of users in the audience
              * `parents_of` for the parents of users in the audience

            Composite audiences will only contain users who are in both of the
            simple audiences.
          examples:
            - summary: Simple audience (users in campus ID 1)
              value: "campus:IjEi:self"
            - summary: Simple audience (parents of users in folder ID 55)
              value: "folder:IjU1Ig==:parents_of"
            - summary: Simple audience (teachers of users in year ID 9)
              value: "folder:Ijki==:teachers_of"
            - summary: Composite audience (users in campus ID 2 and year ID 3)
              value: "composite;self;campus:IjIi:self.year:IjQi:self"
          items:
            type: string
